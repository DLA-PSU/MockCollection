This is an example of a page where a student could display their 3 objects (1 main book and 2 secondary ones) in a "contextual page", that is, with their label and images from items.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="wlh_301" width="75" %}

{% include feature/image.html objectid="wlh_302" width="50" %}

{% include feature/image.html objectid="wlh_303" width="50" %}
